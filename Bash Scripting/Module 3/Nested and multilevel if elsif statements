1) Write a program to output different messages when number is:
   a. Greater than 3
   b. Lesser than 3
   c. Or equal to 3
   d. Or when the user input is empty

Script => read -p "Enter a number: " usernumber
          if [[ -z "$input" ]]; then
              echo "The input is empty."
          else
              if [[ "$userinput" -gt 3 ]]; then
                  echo "The number is greater than 3."
              elif [[ "$userinput" -lt 3 ]]; then
                  echo "The number is lesser than 3."
              else
                  echo "The number is equal to 3."
              fi
          fi
