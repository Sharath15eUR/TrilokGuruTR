 Basics of Shell Scripting

1) Write a simple Bash program to get the following system variables:
    a. pwd
    b. logname

Command => pwd
           logname

2) Write a simple Bash program:
     a. To ask username from user
     b. Exit the program, if user does not enter anything within 10 seconds

Script =>  read -t 10 -p "Type Your Username : " username
           echo "$username"
