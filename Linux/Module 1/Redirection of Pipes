Redirection of Pipes

1. Create a file name error_log in your current directory. Suppose you do not have any file named aa11 in your current directory. 
   How  can you redirect the error message to the file error_log when we apply the command "wc -l aa11" ?  
   How can you ensure that all the error log are appended to the error_log file?

Command => touch error_log
           wc -l aa11 2> error_log
           wc -l aa11 2>> error_log

Explanation => > -> redirection 
               >> -> redirection with appending
               file descriptor 2 is used for standard error (stderr).

2. Create  files named test1, test2, testa, testb
   How can you count the number of files starting with test and then having only one digit in their name using only a single line command ?

Command => touch test1 test2 testa testb
           ls | grep -c "^test[0-9]$"

Explanation => The ls command lists all of the files in the current directory.
               The grep command filters the output of the ls command to only include files that start with test and then have only one digit in their name.
               The wc -l command counts the number of lines in the output of the grep command.
