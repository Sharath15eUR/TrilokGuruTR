Working with processes

1. Open a terminal. Now spawn three shell processes one after another i.e. first spawn one shell, then from the spawned shell, spawn one new shell and so on. Now, 
   how can you see the PID of the current shell ? How can you see the PID of the shell which is the grandparent of the current shell?

Command => /bin/bash -i
            /bin/bash -i
            /bin/bash -i
            ps all
            pstree

Explanation => ps all would show all the running process and their ids
               pstree shows the hierarchy of processes

2. How can you see all the processes (both system & user processes) in your computer?
   The output can be quite large.  How can you view the output as multipage output ? 
   How can you store the output in a file named process_info?

Command => ps -e 
           ps -e | more
           ps -e > process_info
